# Speed Typing Game

This is my first project created to help me in learning JavaScript. It is based on https://youtu.be/Yw-SYSG-028?si=SacI6JLgMSsvN4yx but extra elements have been added. For example, the difficulty selector and differently colored elements. This page was created using HTML and Javascript as well as external CSS provided by the video tutorial. 

This project can be played at https://kzhang1223.github.io/speed-typing-game/.
